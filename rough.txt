                <pre class="lyric text-white">
    Wont go whistling like the wind blows,
    Looking out my window,
    Just to see the shine
    Maybe you might call it crazy,
    How Im acting lately,

    Skipping through the sky



     I see so clearly,

    Why Im always feeling free.

    So I sleep when my dreams,

    Looking like reality



    (Gonna feel it! Na na na...) x4



    Gonna feel it!



    I know where the greener grass grows

    Youll just have to follow

    To the other side



     Lets go tiptoe on a tight rope,

    Fallings only natural

    Just spread your wings and fly



    Youll see so clearly,

    Why Im always feeling free.

    So I sleep when our dreams

    Looking like reality



    (Gonna feel it! Na na na...) x4



    Bring it down like

    Ohh way oh

    Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

    Break it down like

    Ohh way oh

     Yeah, yeah, yeah...

    All around like

    Ohh way oh

    Yeah, yeah, yeah...

    Sing it loud like!

    Ohh way oh

    Ah oo oo ooo



     Gonna feel it! (Na na na...)

     Make it sound like! (Na na na...)

    All around like! (Na na na...)

    Sing it loud like! (Na na na...)

    Gonna feel like! (Na na na...)
